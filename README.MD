## Week One Python Code-Challenge

In this assignment the following was covered:
1. Basic data structures
2. Functions
3. Decorators
4. Sequences
5. Sets, Dictionaries
6. Object-Oriented Programming

<b>Clone the repository</b>
To gain access to the repository, clone it in your machine.
Details of each file are described below.

1. <b>add_numbers</b>
The <strong>add_numbers</strong> function in the function file, takes in two parameters and returns the sum

2. <b>is_even</b>
The <strong>is_even </strong> function in the function file, takes a single parameter, number and 
returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.

3. <b>reverse_string</b>
The function <strong>reverse_string</strong> in the function file, takes a string text as input and 
returns the reversed version of that string.

4. <b>>count_vowels</b>
The function <strong>count_vowels</strong> in the function file, takes a string text as input and 
returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.

5. <b>calculate_factorial</b>
The function <strong>calculate_factorial</strong> in the function file, takes a non-negative integer n as input 
and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product
of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

6. <b>apply_decorator</b>
The function <strong>apply_decorator</strong> in the decorator file takes a function <strong>func</strong>
as input and applies a decorator named <strong>decorator_func</strong>. The decorator <strong>decorator_func</strong>
prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function. The <strong>apply_decorator</strong> function 
returns the decorated version of the original function.

7. <b>sort_by_age</b>
The function <strong>sort_by_age</strong> in the sequence file, takes a list of tuples as input, 
where each tuple contains a name and an age. The function sorts the list by age in ascending order
 and returns the sorted list. The sorting is performed based on the second element (age) in each tuple.

8. <b>merge_dicts</b>
The function <strong>merge_dicts</strong> in the dictionaries file takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys between the two dictionaries, the function sums their corresponding values and includes the result in the merged dictionary.

9. <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>
The class <strong>Car</strong> in the OOP file defines a car with the following attributes: 
<strong>make</strong>, <strong>model</strong>, and <strong>year</strong>. It includes a method named 
<strong>display_info</strong> that prints out the car's information, including its make, model, and year.
